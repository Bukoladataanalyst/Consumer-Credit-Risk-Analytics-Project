Consumer Credit Risk — Portfolio Concentration & Risk Drivers
Executive Credit Risk Analysis using Python, SQL & Power BI
📌 Project Overview

Consumer loan portfolios include borrowers with varying levels of credit risk, making it essential for financial institutions to understand where potential losses are concentrated and what factors drive default behavior. This project provides an executive-level analysis of consumer credit risk by examining default concentration across borrower segments, loan structures, and key financial characteristics.

The analysis is designed to support portfolio monitoring, risk-based pricing assessment, and underwriting decision-making through clear, decision-oriented insights.

🎯 Business Objectives

Identify where default risk is concentrated within the portfolio

Assess how borrower leverage and loan pricing relate to default behavior

Evaluate the impact of loan structure (e.g., term length) on default exposure

Validate underwriting decisions using observed borrower stability indicators

❓ Business Questions

Where is default risk concentrated within the portfolio?

How do leverage and pricing relate to observed default behavior?

Which borrower and loan characteristics drive elevated default risk?

Do observed outcomes support current underwriting decisions?

🧠 Analytical Approach

This project combines advanced data analysis and machine learning with financial risk analysis and executive dashboard reporting:

Data cleaning and feature engineering (Python)

Borrower risk segmentation using unsupervised machine learning

Portfolio-level risk and pricing analysis

Underwriting outcome validation

Executive reporting via a one-page Power BI dashboard

📊 Key Insights

Default risk is not evenly distributed across the portfolio, with a small borrower segment accounting for a disproportionate share of total defaults.

Borrower leverage is a primary driver of default behavior, as default rates increase materially at higher debt-to-income levels.

Longer-term loan products (60-month terms) contribute disproportionately to default exposure, exhibiting higher default rates than shorter-term loans despite higher pricing.

Observed underwriting outcomes are directionally effective, as rejected applicants display weaker employment stability relative to accepted borrowers.

🧾 Data Sources

LendingClub accepted loan data (2007–2018)

LendingClub rejected loan applications

Public, industry-recognized consumer credit datasets

⚠️ Limitations & Governance

Rejected applicants lack complete financial ratios due to early-stage screening

Analysis reflects historical borrower behavior

Results are observational and do not imply causality
